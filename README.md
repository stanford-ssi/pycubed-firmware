# PyCubed Firmware 🔧 - Sequoia Branch

Low-level code implementing CircuitPython (port of Micropython)

Firmware and bootloader configurations are kept here because each of the repositories has many submodules that arent necessary for the project as a whole (and we don't want anyone to accidentally clone them).

Need to build the firmware? Check out Adafruit's guide (make sure you have the latest version of the ARM toolchain)

Feel free to build on the [SSI fork of CircuitPython](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/circuitpython). It might also have the configuration that is stored in `firmware_build/` but when in doubt, use this repository.

Need to build the bootloader? Check out the instructions in the README of the [SSI fork of UF2-SAMD1X](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/uf2-samdx1). It might also have the configuration that is stored in `bootloader_build/` but when in doubt, use this repository.
