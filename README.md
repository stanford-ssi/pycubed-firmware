# PyCubed Firmware ðŸ”§ - Sequoia Branch

Low-level code implementing CircuitPython (port of Micropython)

Firmware and bootloader configurations are kept here because each of the repositories has many submodules that arent necessary for the project as a whole (and we don't want anyone to accidentally clone them).

## Need to build the firmware?

Check out Adafruit's guide (make sure you have the latest version of the ARM toolchain). Feel free to build on the [SSI fork of CircuitPython](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/circuitpython). It might also have the configuration that is stored in `firmware_build/` but when in doubt, use this repository.

## Need to build the bootloader?

Check out the instructions in the README of the [SSI fork of UF2-SAMD1X](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/uf2-samdx1). It might also have the configuration that is stored in `bootloader_build/` but when in doubt, use this repository.
